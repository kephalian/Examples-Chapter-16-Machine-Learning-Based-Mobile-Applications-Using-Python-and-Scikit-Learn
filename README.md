These Python codes did not make it to the final version of the book as 
their Plegiarism software flagged all this code as ??? Plegiarism.

Tell me "import pandas as pd" is Plegiarism?

or "import numpy as np" is Plegiarism?

Such a code is likely to be found a million times on internet.

[These are our original Python programs we wrote for the book chapter](https://github.com/kephalian/Examples-Chapter-16-Machine-Learning-Based-Mobile-Applications-Using-Python-and-Scikit-Learn/blob/main/Machine-Learning-Based-Mobile-Applications-Using-Python-and-Scikit-Learn.pdf) but we deleted in final draft.
